I was invited as a guest speaker to Principles of Sustainability (ESRM 300), a class at the University of Washington taught by Professor Lisa Graumlich. I spoke to students about the work I was doing with the CESA club on campus, as well as how computing can impact the fields of environmental and social advocacy.
