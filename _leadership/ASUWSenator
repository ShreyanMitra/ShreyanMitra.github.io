As a designated student Senator at the University of Washington, I represent a constituency of around 1000 students in the university's student governing body. I work with other senators to craft and vote on legislation that makes the campus more safe, sustainable, and a fun place to learn. I am part of the following committees: General Affairs, Campus Affairs, Oversight, and Governance.
