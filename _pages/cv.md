My resume is basically this entire website condensed into one page :smile:.

You'll have the option to either download my resume or see it the embedded viewer below. Note that this resume may be a bit outdated. I try to update it at least once a month. For a more detailed CV, please visit my [LinkedIn profile](linkedin.com/in/shreyanmitra), where you can also connect with me.
