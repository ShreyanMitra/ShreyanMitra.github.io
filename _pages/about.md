Hello! :wave: I'm Shreyan Mitra, a student at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. In recent years, machine learning (ML) has become a hot topic because of its tremendous capabilities and numerous applications. However, with great power comes great responsibility. 

Because of this, I have focused my college research career on the following three areas:

1. ML Robustness - Making ML models less susceptible to error and more applicable to the tasks at hand.
2. ML Accessibility - Ensuring people of different backgrounds, ages, and coding experiences can use ML tools to make their lives easier.
3. Social and Environmental Impact - Ensuring ML, and artificial intelligence (AI) in general, are used in ethical and sustainable ways to further social and conservation goals.
